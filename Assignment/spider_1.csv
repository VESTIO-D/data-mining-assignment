It covers an area of two square kilometres and is situated along Sheikh Zayed Road, in the heart of Dubai, mid-way between old Dubai. It is connected to the Dubai Metro via the Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station. Property Downtown is highly sought after, largely due to the Burj Khalifa views and access to Dubai Mall. The Burj Khalifa is the centrepiece of Downtown Dubai. At 828 metres, it is the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure ever built. The Dubai Mall retains the title of the world's largest shopping mall by total area, home to around 1,200 shops in addition to in-mall attractions, such as an ice rink, an aquarium and water zoo and a waterfall, in reality, a man-made water feature. No matter which property development you choose in Downtown Dubai, a comfortable, contemporary lifestyle awaits.
